		<h1>What's this all about?</h1>
		<p>This quiz is a personal project I built, first and foremost, as a conclusion to <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">this JavaScript study course</a>. It's also meant to help me study and identify typefaces.</p>
		<p>"Can you identify fonts?" I have been asked this question several times over the last year.</p>
		<p>I decided to build a simple quiz that would focus my attention on the anatomy of a particular font. I've tried other tools and methods, but they all seemed to focus either strictly on typeface anatomy in general (counter, terminal, crossbar, etc.) or words set in a particular font that I needed to identify (similar to this quiz).</p> 
		<p>I hope to set this quiz apart by drawing attention to the specific anatomy of a particular typeface and providing additional information (when available) about that anatomy.</p>
