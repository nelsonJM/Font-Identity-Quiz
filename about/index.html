			<h1>What's this all about?</h1>
			<p>I built this quiz shortly after completing <a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">this JavaScript study course</a>. It's purpose is twofold: </p>
			<ol>
				<li>A practical application of JavaScript</li>
				<li>An opportunity to study fonts/typefaces/letters wearing cool suits</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>"Can you identify fonts?"</h2>
			<p>This a job interview question I was once asked. Silly question? Maybe. But it has been stuck in my head for some time and I thought it might make a good topic for a small project.</p>
			<p>I decided to build a simple quiz that would focus my attention on the anatomy of a particular font. I've tried other tools and methods, but they all seemed to focus either strictly on typeface anatomy in general (counter, terminal, crossbar, etc.) or words set in a particular font that I needed to identify (similar to this quiz).</p> 
			<h2>Fonts? Typefaces?</h2>
			<p>Here's some comfort food:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://nerdplusart.com/type-terminology-smackdown/" >http://nerdplusart.com/type-terminology-smackdown/</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>I hope to set this quiz apart by drawing attention to the specific anatomy of a particular typeface and providing additional information (when available) about that anatomy.</p>
